Welcome :). 
    
I'm working costantly on expanding this repository as well as my programming skills. 

Currently I'm improving my "LoginAndRegistrationSystem" and this is the biggest project in this repo so far. 

Lists 1-10 include my solutions to simple tasks covering e.g. functions, structures, pointers and arrays, so feel free to check out how I handled them. The complexity increases with each list but I try to make solving each one of them an opportunity to learn something new so there are e.g. templates, extern inputValidation function written by me and so on.
