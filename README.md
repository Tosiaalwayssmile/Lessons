**Welcome :).** 
    
I'm working costantly on expanding this repository as well as my programming skills. 

Currently I'm improving my **"LoginAndRegistrationSystem"** and this is the biggest project in this repo so far. 

Lists 1-6 include my solutions to simple **C++** tasks covering e.g. functions, structures, pointers and arrays, so feel free to check out how I handled them. The complexity increases with each list but I try to make solving each one of them an opportunity to learn something new so there are e.g. **templates**, extern inputValidation function written by me and so on.

Also feel free to checkout my **other repos** like **ProjectUniversitySQL**, which is an **SQL-project**.

I've started learning Python so in repo "PythonLessons" you can find some basic exercises that I did. 

Repo **DeepLearning** is a work in progress.
