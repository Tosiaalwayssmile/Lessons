Welcome :). I'm working costantly on expanding this repository as well as my programming skills. 
Currently I'm improving my "LoginAndRegistrationSystem" and this is the biggest project in this repo so far. 
Lists 1-10 include my solutions to simple tasks covering e.g. functions, structures, pointers and arrays, so feel free to check out how I handled them. 
The complexity increases with each list. :)
