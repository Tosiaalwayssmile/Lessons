Lists 1-6 include my solutions to simple **C++** tasks covering e.g. functions, structures, pointers and arrays, so feel free to check out how I handled them. The complexity increases with each list but I try to make solving each one of them an opportunity to learn something new so there are e.g. **templates**, extern inputValidation function written by me and so on.
